# .NET Dependency Injection Mechanisms

This repository contains four separate projects, each demonstrating different levels of dependency injection mechanisms in .NET. The projects are classified as **Wrong**, **Good**, **Better**, and **Best**, each highlighting a specific approach to managing dependencies in a .NET application. Additionally, each project includes unit tests to showcase how dependency injection improves testability.

## Wrong

The **Wrong** project demonstrates an incorrect approach to managing dependencies. It creates an instance of the needed object directly inside the method, leading to tight coupling and reduced flexibility in changing implementations.

## Good

The **Good** project introduces a better approach using interfaces. It defines an `ISender` interface, which is implemented by `IMailSender` and `ITelSender`. The instance of the sender is created in the `Program.cs` and passed into the constructor, promoting loose coupling and easier swapping of implementations. This approach also includes unit tests that leverage dependency injection to provide mock implementations of the `ISender` interface for testing different scenarios.

## Better

The **Better** project takes advantage of .NET's built-in Dependency Injection (DI) system. It uses the `DependencyInjection` package to configure dependency injection in the application. Dependencies are registered using `AddSingleton`, `AddScoped`, or `AddTransient` methods to manage the lifecycle of the objects. This approach further enhances testability, as dependencies can be easily mocked and injected during unit testing.

## Best

The **Best** project extends the **Better** approach by externalizing the dependency configuration. It uses an XML file to define the dependencies, eliminating the need to recompile the program to change from a `TelSender` to a `MailSender`. This approach enhances configurability and maintainability of the application and continues to make testing and mocking straightforward.
